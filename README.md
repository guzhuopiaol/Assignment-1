# Assignment-1

The assignment is divided into two folders and a pdf file. The pdf file contains a display of the replication results and a brief discussion.

Raw data, cleaned data, dofile, logfile and results are presented separately. 
Regarding replication: If you use original data, you can use whole dofiles to replicate my results. But if you use cleaned data, paper1 should start from line 206 of paper 1's dofile, paper2 should start from paper 2's dofile line 183 (if you want to replicate descriptive statistics, please re-enter the code in line 150)
